    "Before we begin, let's clarify what an algorthim is. In this course, an **algorithm** is simply a procedure or formula for solving a problem. Some problems are famous enough that the algorithms have names, as well as some procdures being common enough that the algorithm associated with it also has a name. So now we have a good question we need to answer:\n",

The [**%timeit**](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html#magic-timeit) magic in Jupyter Notebooks will repeat the loop iteration a certain number of times and take the best result.
